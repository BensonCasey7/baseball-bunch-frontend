Each neighbor votes for their class and the majority of the closest votes is taken as the prediction for the datapoint.

It constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes from the training data set. The core idea of SVC is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH) that optimally divides the given dataset into multiple classes. The algorithm can then classify new data points based on the hyperplane. The algorithm studies all the training data in a multi-dimensional space and comes with a hyperplane for a decision boundary. It then takes the datapoints i.e. performance stats of baseball team drafted by the user and predicts the likely class label whether team is going to be champion or not based on the decision boundary evaluated.",
